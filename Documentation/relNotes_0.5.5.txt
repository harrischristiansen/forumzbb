To-Do:
-New Theme
	-Forums -> Black on white

Issues:
-Why do emails take so long to send?
-Put space on each side of menubar (med size)
-Setting permissions for new rank via addRank
-Fix Theme not loading when no files present (auto-redirect to known theme...)
-Control Panel -> Edit Profile - current email not showing up
-Not putting <br> in shortDate on viewBlog (maybe fixed?)
-Google Analytics in header
-Make mail RFC 5322 compliant
-Blog titles ' -> \'
-Can users delete own blog posts (prob not). Make either yes or no (right now delete button shows up but next page denies permission)
